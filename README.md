# ReadAndWrite
A simple program for scanning directories


1. Specify which directory is required for scanning (the full path to the directory)
  Example: C:\Program Files\Virtual Desktop\Effects
2. The name of the output file (The file in which all folders and files in the directory will be written)
If you have crashed the program, then try to run it through cmds
Also, the program does not work correctly with directories in which there are either no files or there is only one 
(During the tests I had questions about Windows)
The output file will be created in the program directory
Example output: 
1 - Captures
2 - desktop.ini
3 - Radeon ReLive
